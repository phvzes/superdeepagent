# SuperDeepAgent

SuperDeepAgent is an advanced AI agent system with feedback, improvement, and metalearning capabilities. It is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for building, deploying, and improving AI agents.

## Architecture

SuperDeepAgent consists of the following main components:

1. **Backend**
   - Agents: Integration with SuperAGI and other agent frameworks
   - Feedback: System for collecting and processing user and system feedback
   - Improvement: Mechanisms for improving agent performance based on feedback
   - Metalearning: Framework for learning across tasks and transferring knowledge
   - Models: LLM pipeline and provider integrations

2. **Frontend**
   - React/Next.js based dashboard for monitoring and controlling agents
   - Components for visualizing feedback, improvements, and metalearning metrics
   - API integration with the backend

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker configurations for local development
   - Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
   - GPU support via CUDA/ROCm or Metal (macOS)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- (Optional) Kubernetes cluster for production deployment
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU with CUDA or AMD GPU with ROCm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/superdeepagent.git
   cd superdeepagent
   ```

2. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   # Start the backend
   cd ../backend
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   
   # Start the frontend (in a separate terminal)
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Alternatively, use Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml up
   ```
